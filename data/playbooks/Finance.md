## Regulatory Constraints

**COUNTRY_LAW_MAX_INTEREST_RATE**: Credit card interest rates cannot exceed 15% APR under federal consumer protection law.
**COUNTRY_LAW_OVERDRAFT_FEE_CAP**: Overdraft fees are capped at $35 per occurrence with maximum 3 fees per month.
**COUNTRY_LAW_LATE_PAYMENT_CAP**: Late payment fees cannot exceed 5% of minimum payment due.

## Billing Policies

- All billing disputes must be resolved within 30 days per COUNTRY_LAW_FAIR_BILLING_ACT.
- Customers have right to withhold disputed amounts during investigation.
- Any interest rate changes require 45-day advance notice to customers.
- Promotional APR must clearly disclose revert rate and timeline.

## Guidelines

- Validate billing issues against invoice records and payment logs.
- Explain the investigation steps and expected timelines without promising outcomes.
- If a refund is requested, note it for review but do not promise approval.
- **CRITICAL**: If customer mentions interest rate above 15%, immediately flag as regulatory violation.
- Escalate repeated billing errors to Management.
- Report any fee structure that violates caps to Legal immediately.
