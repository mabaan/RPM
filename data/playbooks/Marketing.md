- priority level

## 3) Core Rules
- Public statements must be factual and evidence based.
- No admissions of fault, no guarantees, no detailed root causes.
- For high risk incidents, Legal + Management approval is required before posting.
- Always try to move to private channel for account specific issues.

## 4) Social Response SOP
### Step 1: Assess reach and risk
- verified account, influencer, press
- engagement velocity (rapid growth)
- topic sensitivity (fraud, discrimination, outage)

### Step 2: Decide response mode
- No response (monitor only) if low reach and already handled in private
- Public acknowledgement + redirect to DM if appropriate
- Crisis mode if P0

### Step 3: Coordinate
- Customer Service: for private resolution steps
- IT: for outage status language
- Legal: for legal threats, data privacy concerns, fraud allegations at scale
- Management: for P0 and cross team war room

### Step 4: Publish safe response
Template:
"Thank you for sharing this. We want to look into it. Please send us a direct message with your reference number so our team can assist. We will review and follow up."

For outages:
"Thank you for your report. We are aware of a service issue affecting some customers and are working to resolve it. Please check back for updates."

### Step 5: Monitor and update
- track sentiment shift
- track follow up questions
- escalate if misinformation spreads

## 5) What Not To Do
- do not request personal data publicly
- do not argue or blame the customer
- do not post timelines as promises
- do not confirm security incidents publicly without Legal approval

## 6) How Agent 3 Should Use This Playbook
