# Product Playbook

Version: 1.0
Owner: Product Lead (demo)
Applies to: usability complaints, feature requests, confusing flows, recurring customer friction, roadmap inputs

## 1) Mission
Turn customer pain into structured product insights, prioritize what matters, and close the loop with other teams without making commitments.

## 2) Inputs From Dashboard
- summary and evidence
- user segment (if known)
- channel and product area
- trend indicators (repeat mentions, social reach)

## 3) Core Rules
- Capture context first, then propose changes.
- No commitments on roadmap or timelines.
- Validate with data before escalating.

## 4) Product Triage SOP
### Step 1: Categorize
- bug vs UX friction vs missing feature vs policy misunderstanding

### Step 2: Capture reproduction context
- app version
- device OS
- screenshots or error text (via Customer Service if needed)
- frequency and impacted users

### Step 3: Check for known issues
- current release notes
- open incidents
- known defects list

### Step 4: Create product insight entry
Minimum fields:
- title
- customer impact statement
- evidence quotes
- severity and reach
- proposed next step (investigate, design review, quick fix)

### Step 5: Coordinate
- to Development/IT: for validated defects or performance problems
- to Marketing: for messaging or UX clarifications
- to Customer Service: for customer guidance updates

## 5) Trend Detection Guidance
If multiple incidents match:
- group into one theme
- estimate volume and growth
- highlight potential reputational risk

## 6) What Not To Do
- do not promise features
- do not publicly confirm product defects without IT confirmation and Management approval

## 7) How Agent 3 Should Use This Playbook
- reverse prompt should generate:
  - a short product insight card
  - follow up questions to confirm context
  - a suggested internal ticket for Development/IT
  - a safe customer explanation draft (without commitments)
