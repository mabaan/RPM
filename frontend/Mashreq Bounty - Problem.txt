Mashreq Bounty - Problem 
Statement 
Challenge Title: AI for Social Signal Intelligence in Banking 
Field / Domain: Banking / Responsible AI 
Problem Statement 
Overview  
Banks operate in an environment where public sentiment, misinformation, and service issues 
can escalate rapidly through social and digital channels. The challenge is not to monitor 
individuals, but to responsibly interpret public social signals to protect customer trust, brand 
reputation, and operational resilience. Mashreq is joining this hackathon to explore how 
responsible AI systems can help banks detect, explain, and respond to such signals with 
strong governance and human oversight. 
What Participants Are Required to Do 
Design an AI system that helps a bank detect, interpret, and responsibly respond to public 
social signals that may impact brand trust, customer experience, or operational risk, without 
using real social media data or personal information. 
This challenge focuses on AI reasoning, system design, explainability, and governance, not 
on data scraping or model training. 
Required Scenarios: Each team must demonstrate their solution across at least two of the 
following: 
● Brand Sentiment Shift: Detect emerging positive or negative sentiment trends and 
explain drivers. 
● Service or Incident Signals: Identify early warning signs of disruption or customer 
impact. 
● Fraud or Scam Rumors: Detect public discussions suggesting fraudulent activity. 
● Misinformation or False Claims: Assess reputational or operational risk from 
unverified claims. 
● Executive Insight Briefing: Summarize key signals into a concise leadership 
briefing. 
The solution must include: 
A prototype demonstrating:  
● Signal detection and aggregation logic 
● Risk and impact interpretation 
● Explainable insights (“why this matters”) 
● Confidence and uncertainty handling 
● Human escalation and review workflows 
No automated decision-making or actions are required or expected. 
Strict Constraints 
Participants must not: 
● Use live social media platforms (e.g. X, LinkedIn, Facebook) 
● Scrape or ingest real posts or feeds 
● Use personal data or identifiable information 
● Profile individuals or automate public responses 
Participants must: 
● Use synthetic or team-created example posts 
● Work with aggregated, abstracted social signals 
● Design with human-in-the-loop controls 
Responsible AI Requirements 
● Clear confidence scoring or uncertainty indicators 
● Explicit non-action boundaries 
● Human approval checkpoints 
● Explainability and auditability 
● Ethical risk considerations 
Solutions missing these elements cannot be considered for top prizes. 
Judging Criteria 
Solutions will be evaluated based on: 
● Relevance to banking & brand trust 
● Quality of signal interpretation 
● Explainability & transparency 
● Responsible AI & governance design 
● Usability & clarity of presentation 
Note: Solutions missing Responsible AI elements (guardrails/human-in-the-loop) cannot be 
considered for top prizes. 
Mode of Submission 
Teams must submit: 
● GitHub Repo + 2-minute explanation video (used for shortlisting top 5-8 teams). 
● Live Pitching (approx. 10 mins) for shortlisted teams only.
